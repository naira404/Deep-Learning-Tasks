# Deep Learning & AI Tasks Repository
## Team Collaboration
These Tasks was developed in collaboration with Ftama Alzahraa Abdullah

This repository contains a collection of deep learning and machine learning tasks implemented using Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras.  
Each task focuses on a specific concept in Neural Networks, CNNs, NLP, RNNs, Seq2Seq models, Autoencoders, and GANs.
